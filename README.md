# HackTheBox Getting Started Lab

Welcome to the **HackTheBox Getting Started Lab** repository! This repository contains a detailed walkthrough of key ethical hacking techniques and tools explored through various HackTheBox challenges. The lab focuses on building hands-on expertise in areas such as network scanning, vulnerability exploitation, and privilege escalation.

## **Overview**
This repository is a practical guide to using tools like Nmap, Metasploit, and Gobuster, alongside SSH and privilege escalation techniques. By following the steps outlined here, you'll gain valuable insights into:
- Network enumeration and service discovery.
- Exploiting public vulnerabilities and understanding their impact.
- Leveraging privilege escalation methods to enhance system access.

## **Key Tasks Covered**
1. **Basic Tools**  
   - Introduction to SSH for remote connections and Netcat for interacting with TCP/UDP ports.  
   - Practical exercises in using Vim and banner grabbing.  

2. **Service Scanning**  
   - Exploring Nmap for port scanning and service version detection.  
   - Techniques for identifying running services, non-default ports, and SMB shares.  

3. **Web Enumeration**  
   - Using Gobuster for directory/file discovery and subdomain enumeration.  
   - Extracting sensitive data and hidden credentials for exploitation.  

4. **Public Exploits**  
   - Working with Metasploit to identify and exploit known vulnerabilities.  
   - Step-by-step walkthrough for exploiting a backup service vulnerability.  

5. **Privilege Escalation**  
   - Techniques for elevating user privileges to root/admin.  
   - Navigating restricted directories and exploiting misconfigurations.  

6. **Advanced Enumeration**  
   - Engaging with real-world scenarios using the Nibble and Knowledge Check challenges.  
   - Advanced usage of tools like Curl, WhatWeb, and shell commands.  

## **Tools and Commands**
- **Nmap:** For port and service scanning.  
  ```bash
  nmap -sV -sC <target_ip>
gobuster dir -u <target_ip> -w /path/to/wordlist
msfconsole
search <exploit>
use <exploit_path>
ssh <user>@<target_ip> -p <port>

**Conclusion**
This lab equips you with foundational skills in ethical hacking, focusing on real-world scenarios to develop your technical expertise. From identifying vulnerabilities to escalating privileges, the tasks provide a comprehensive understanding of modern cybersecurity challenges. Explore, learn, and strengthen your skills with this hands-on approach to ethical hacking!
